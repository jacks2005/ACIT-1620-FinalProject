                    <div class="review-text"><b>The Fantastic Four: First Steps</b> reintroduces Marvel’s iconic
                        superhero team in a retro-futuristic world inspired by the optimistic sci-fi of the 1960s,
                        filled with sleek chrome designs, experimental space programs, and cosmic exploration. The film
                        centers on Reed Richards, Sue Storm, Johnny Storm, and Ben Grimm, whose lives are changed
                        dramatically after a scientific mission goes wrong, giving them extraordinary powers. Reed gains
                        the ability to stretch his body, Sue can turn invisible and create forcefields, Johnny becomes a
                        living flame, and Ben transforms into a super-strong rock-like being. The story follows their
                        struggle to adjust to these changes, not just physically but emotionally, as they navigate fame,
                        fear, and the weight of responsibility. As they grow into their new roles, a cosmic threat
                        emerges in the form of signals and distortions hinting at the presence of Galactus, setting the
                        stage for a larger crisis beyond Earth. The team must work together for the first time,
                        balancing interpersonal conflict with the need to contain increasingly catastrophic cosmic
                        anomalies. The film focuses on themes of scientific curiosity, family unity, and the pressure of
                        being humanity’s first line of defense. Its nostalgic aesthetic and tone differentiate it from
                        previous adaptations, emphasizing adventure, optimism, and the beginning of a much broader
                        Marvel cosmic narrative. By the end, the Fantastic Four stand united not just as a team of
                        heroes but as a family, ready for the threats to come.</div>

                    <div class="review-text"><b>Godzilla Minus One</b> is a post-war character-driven monster drama that
                        follows Kōichi Shikishima, a former kamikaze pilot who survives a terrifying, unexpected
                        encounter with Godzilla on a remote military outpost during the final days of World War II.
                        Paralyzed by fear, he fails to fire his weapon, and the monster kills nearly everyone on the
                        island, leaving Shikishima carrying unbearable survivor’s guilt. Returning to Tokyo, he finds
                        his home destroyed, his parents dead, and the city devastated by bombings. He begins living in
                        the ruins with a young woman named Noriko and an orphaned infant she rescued, forming an
                        improvised family unit that gives him a fragile sense of purpose. To support them, Shikishima
                        takes a job clearing naval mines, a dangerous task that mirrors his desire for self-punishment.
                        Meanwhile, Godzilla, mutated further by American nuclear testing, reemerges stronger, angrier,
                        and nearly unstoppable. As the monster marches toward Japan, civilians, engineers, and former
                        navy personnel join together to create a desperate plan using limited post-war resources. They
                        aim to lure Godzilla into deep waters, crush it using pressure from inflatable airbags, and then
                        destroy its core by detonating explosives. Shikishima volunteers for the most dangerous role:
                        flying a restored fighter plane packed with explosives directly into Godzilla’s mouth. The plan
                        works, Godzilla is blown apart, and Shikishima miraculously survives. However, the ending hints
                        at lingering danger as a piece of Godzilla begins to regenerate, suggesting the threat is not
                        gone and the wounds of war — personal and national — are far from healed.</div>

                    <div class="review-text"><b>One Battle After Another</b> is a chaotic, emotionally intense drama
                        that centers on Bob Ferguson, a former revolutionary who has been hiding from the world for
                        years. He lives in isolation with his daughter Willa, trying to shield her from the violent past
                        he abandoned. When Willa is suddenly kidnapped, Bob is thrust back into the world of
                        conspiracies, betrayals, and deadly political factions he once was part of. The narrative jumps
                        between two timelines: the present-day chase to rescue Willa and the past, where Bob was
                        involved in the radical organization “French 75,” known for its militant ideology and
                        clandestine operations. Through these flashbacks, the film reveals the emotional scars,
                        ideological conflicts, and betrayals that destroyed the movement and separated Bob from Willa’s
                        mother, Perfidia, who vanished under mysterious circumstances. As Bob retraces his old steps, he
                        confronts former allies, enemies, and the moral ambiguity of the movement that once defined him.
                        The film blends dark humor, political satire, and hyper-stylized action while exploring themes
                        such as ideological extremism, the cost of revolution, and the personal fallout of violent
                        causes. Bob’s journey becomes a desperate attempt to find redemption and rescue the only person
                        who still believes in him. The story builds to a frantic and emotionally heavy climax where Bob
                        confronts the last remnants of the old world he created, forcing him to choose between the man
                        he was and the father he needs to become.</div>
